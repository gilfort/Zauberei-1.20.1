What is "Zauberei"?
=======

Zauberei is German for witchcraft or magic. 
This mod aims to be base for an all-magic modpack, featuring a school uniform which applies different buffs based on achievements, your major and other things. 

Please bear with me, as I have no idea what I'm doing :)
Credit for most of my code goes to kaupenjoe (for his Neoforge tutorial) and redspace (Code of Iron's Spells and Spellbooks)
-- I hope at some point I'll be able to really understand what the hell I'm writing :D

If you want to join the development, say a word!
